    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> a high school senior passionate about technology, problem-solving, and leadership. Currently, I serve as the president of my school’s technology club, where I lead a team of students in exploring cybersecurity, coding, and robotics. This role has given me the opportunity to apply my technical skills while also learning how to manage projects, organize events, and collaborate with others to achieve shared goals.

            I’m deeply interested in the intersection of technology and social impact. Recently, I organized a workshop on digital privacy and cyberbullying prevention, which empowered over 100 students with knowledge on protecting their online safety. My goal is to continue using my skills to contribute positively to my community, both in and outside of the classroom.
            
            Whether it’s through coding, leading a team, or learning something new, I am constantly looking for ways to grow and make a meaningful impact.”</p >
